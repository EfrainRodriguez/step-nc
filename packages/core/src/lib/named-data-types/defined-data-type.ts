 * Defined data types are declared by type declarations (see 9.1). A defined data type is assigned
 * a type identifier by the user. A defined data type is referenced by this identifier.

/**
 * Defined data types from EXPRESS are mapped here to TypeScript type aliases using the keyword type.
 * For example, the following EXPRESS code:
 *
 * TYPE volume = REAL;
 * END_TYPE;
 *
 * is mapped to the following TypeScript code:
 *
 * type Volume = RealType;
